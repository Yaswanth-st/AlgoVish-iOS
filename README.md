# 📱 AlgoVish – Visualizing Data Structures & Algorithms in SwiftUI

**AlgoVish** is a SwiftUI-powered iOS app that helps students visually understand **Data Structures & Algorithms**. Built as part of the **Apple Swift Student Challenge 2025**, this project was born from a simple idea: _"What if DSA didn’t have to be scary?"_ 🧠💡

## ✨ Features

🔍 **Search Algorithms**  
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  

🔄 **Sorting Algorithms**  
- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Quick Sort  

📚 **Data Structures**  
- Stack (Push, Pop, Peek)  
- Queue (Enqueue, Dequeue, Circular Queue)  
- Linked List (Singly Linked Traversal)

📊 **Visual Feedback**  
Watch elements move and update in real-time, helping connect code logic with output behavior.

🎨 **UI Customization**  
You can change the background theme (I changed mine like 30 times at midnight before deciding to just keep it simple 😅).

## 🧠 Why AlgoVish?

I often found myself stuck while learning DSA — dry explanations and confusing diagrams just weren’t doing it. So, I made something I wish I had: a tool that **shows you how the algorithm works**, rather than just telling you.

From hours of refactoring to fixing that *one button* that ruined *every other screen*, this app was a chaotic but rewarding ride. Now it’s here to help you too 🚀

Big thanks to the team at Apple Innovation Studio, my fellow peer mentors, and our wonderful mentor-educators who trusted me to co-lead, even when my SwiftUI was still throwing red lines every five minutes. And of course — my batchmates who clicked a selfie every time a button changed color 📸😂
